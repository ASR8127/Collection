# Color Detection 
In this color detection Python project, we can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values.

## The project folder contains 3 files:

- Color_detection.py – main source code of our project.
- Colorpic.jpg – sample image for experimenting.
- Colors.csv – a file that contains our dataset.
The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.

## How to run
### you can run the Python file from the command prompt

python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>
